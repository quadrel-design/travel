# PostgreSQL Migration: Immediate Next Steps

Based on our investigation of the corrupted image issue, here are the immediate next steps to complete the Firestore to PostgreSQL migration:

## 1. Fix the PostgresInvoiceRepository Implementation

- Complete the implementation of `lib/repositories/postgres_invoice_repository.dart`:
  - Fix the method signature for `uploadInvoiceImage` to match the interface
  - Implement missing methods (`addProject`, `updateProject`)
  - Fix type errors (e.g., Uint8List vs List<int>)
  - Update error handling and logging methods

## 2. Create API Endpoints in Backend

- Implement REST API endpoints in the invoice-service for:
  - Projects: CRUD operations
  - Invoices: CRUD operations
  - Invoice images: Upload, retrieve, delete, update analysis
  - Ensure proper error handling and logging

## 3. Remove Firestore References from Flutter App

- Update `main.dart` to remove Firestore initialization
- Remove direct Firestore imports and references in screens and widgets
- Update screens with image display to use PostgreSQL data sources

## 4. Handle the Stream Problem

The core issue we found was with streams still trying to access non-existent Firestore data. Implement:
- Polling mechanism for important real-time data
- Manual refresh buttons for data that doesn't need to be real-time
- Update UI components to handle data loading states gracefully

## 5. Update Model Classes

- Remove Firestore-specific conversions from model classes
- Ensure proper serialization/deserialization for REST API responses

## 6. Test and Validate

- Test all core flows:
  - Project creation
  - Invoice image upload
  - Analysis processing
  - Project listing
  - Image viewing
- Validate data integrity between backend PostgreSQL and frontend

## 7. Clean Up

- Remove all unused Firestore code once migration is complete
- Update dependencies in pubspec.yaml to remove Firestore if no longer needed
- Remove any temporary migration code

## 8. Deployment

- Deploy the updated backend services with PostgreSQL integration
- Deploy the updated Flutter app with PostgreSQL data handling
- Monitor for any issues in production

## Priority Action Items

1. **First priority**: Fix the image loading in `invoice_capture_overview_screen.dart` to properly handle missing images
2. **Second priority**: Complete the PostgreSQL repository implementation
3. **Third priority**: Test the complete flow with the new implementation
