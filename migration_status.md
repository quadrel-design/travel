# Firestore to PostgreSQL Migration Status

## Overview
We are in the process of migrating our travel application from Firestore to PostgreSQL. This document outlines the current progress, challenges, and next steps.

## Completed Steps

1. **Repository Implementation**
   - Created `postgres_invoice_repository.dart` to replace Firestore repository
   - Fixed method signatures to match the original interface
   - Implemented REST API calls to backend services instead of direct Firestore access
   - Added error handling for database operations

2. **Provider Updates**
   - Updated `repository_providers.dart` to use the new PostgreSQL repository
   - Removed Firestore dependencies in providers
   - Maintained stream-like interface for UI compatibility

3. **UI Resilience**
   - Enhanced `invoice_capture_overview_screen.dart` to better handle missing images
   - Added visual indicators for various failure states
   - Improved error handling with more specific recovery options

## Current Challenges

1. **Incomplete Backend API Endpoints**
   - Some required API endpoints may not yet be implemented on the backend
   - Need to ensure all necessary CRUD operations are supported

2. **Image Processing Flow**
   - The image upload and analysis flow needs to be tested end-to-end
   - Potential issues with image references between GCS and PostgreSQL

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Ensuring all data migrated from Firestore to PostgreSQL is intact
   - Handling edge cases like special characters in fields

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Backend API Implementation**
   - Ensure all needed REST API endpoints exist on the PostgreSQL backend
   - Test each endpoint thoroughly with different data scenarios

2. **Implement Expense Repository**
   - Create `postgres_expense_repository.dart` 
   - Update expense-related screens to use the new repository

3. **Remove Remaining Firestore Dependencies**
   - Update `main.dart` to remove Firestore initialization
   - Remove direct Firestore imports and references in other screens
   - Update pub dependencies to remove unnecessary Firebase packages

4. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive tests for the new PostgreSQL repositories
   - Validate all functionality against test data
   - Perform load testing on critical paths

## Known Issues

1. **Corrupted Image Problem**
   - When an image is missing in GCS but its record exists in the database, the app previously crashed
   - This has been fixed by adding better error handling in `invoice_capture_overview_screen.dart`
   - Still need to ensure database is properly cleaned up when images are deleted

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - We're keeping Firebase Auth but removing Firestore
   - Need to verify all auth-related flows work with the new architecture

3. **Stream Simulation**
   - Firestore provided real-time updates via streams
   - Currently simulating streams with HTTP requests, which isn't fully real-time
   - May need to implement polling or WebSocket connections for critical real-time features
