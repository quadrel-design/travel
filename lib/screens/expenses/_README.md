# Expense Screens

This directory contains screens related to expense management in the Travel application.

## File Overview

### `expense_list_screen.dart`
A placeholder screen for displaying expenses associated with a project. Currently shows a message indicating that expense functionality is temporarily disabled while project features are being migrated. This screen will eventually display a list of expenses with totals, filtering options, and the ability to create and edit expenses.

## Future Development

This directory is expected to expand with additional screens as expense management features are implemented:

- `expense_create_screen.dart` - For creating new expenses
- `expense_detail_screen.dart` - For viewing and editing expense details
- `expense_analysis_screen.dart` - For analyzing expense patterns and categories

These screens will integrate with the expense repository and provide functionality for tracking, categorizing, and sharing expenses associated with travel projects.
